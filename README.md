# TextEditor

A new terminal-based text editor with scripting and stuff.

## Ideas

- A functional, possibly post-fix-y or composition-oriented scripting language

- Live script previewing

- Navigation commands include things like going to previous locations

- ~Good non-moded key combos for navigation, selection, deletion, etc. in a nano-like way~ Everything except local navigation is through the command interface
