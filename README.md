# TextEditor

A new terminal-based text editor with scripting and stuff.

## Ideas

- A functional, possibly post-fix-y or composition-oriented scripting language

- Live script previewing

- Navigation commands include things like going to previous locations

- ~Good non-moded key combos for navigation, selection, deletion, etc. in a nano-like way~ Everything except local navigation is through the command interface

- Commands are typed. Some need to operate at a location, some operate on selections

- Fundamental non-deterministic in certain aspects (e.g. selections, locations, etc.)

## Commands

- Setting the name
- Saving
- Changing display info?
- Navigation
- Selection
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Regex Replacement?
- Search
- Cut, Copy, Paste
- History
